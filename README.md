## Scope Boundaries (Out of Scope)

This project is implemented to meet the TalentLabs Blogging Platform rubric requirements (Auth, Blog Features, Code Quality).

The following items are intentionally NOT built for this submission:

- Roles/permissions: No role-based access control (e.g. admin/editor/user roles).
- Advanced pagination: No page numbers, infinite scroll, sorting/filtering, or cursor-based pagination. Only the required "Next post" navigation is implemented.
- Profile management: No user profile page, edit profile, avatar upload, or account settings UI.
- Production-grade security: This is a learning project and is not hardened for production (e.g. no rate limiting, security headers configuration, full CSRF strategy, or security audit).
